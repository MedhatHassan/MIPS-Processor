<h1>Components of a MIPS Processor</h1>
<p>This project provides a detailed description of the components that make up a MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor. </p>
<p>Understanding the different components of a processor is important for anyone interested in computer architecture or embedded systems design.</p>

<h2>The components of a MIPS processor include:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Program Counter (PC): The PC is a register that contains the address of the next instruction to be executed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Instruction Register (IR): The IR is a register unit that stores the instructions to be executed. During the Instruction Fetch (IF) stage, the processor reads an instruction from the IM using the address stored in the PC.
