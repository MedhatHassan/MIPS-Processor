<h1>RTL</h1>
<h3>stands for <b>"Register Transfer Level"</b>. It is a type of digital circuit design methodology that is used to describe the behavior of a digital system at the register transfer level.</h3>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h4>RTL design is used extensively in microprocessor design, as it allows designers to create complex digital systems using a modular approach. In an RTL design, the microprocessor is broken down into smaller, more manageable blocks, each of which is described in terms of the registers and logic circuits that make up that block.</h4>
