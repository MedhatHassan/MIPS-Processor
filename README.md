<h1>MIPS Processor Implementation in VHDL</h1>
<p>The MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor is a type of Reduced Instruction Set Computer<b> (RISC) </b>microprocessor architecture. It was developed by MIPS Technologies in the 1980s and has since been used in a variety of embedded systems, such as routers, gaming consoles, and digital cameras.

The MIPS processor is characterized by its simplicity, high performance, and low power consumption. It has a fixed instruction length of 32 bits and a simple instruction set that consists of only a few basic instructions. This allows the processor to execute instructions quickly and efficiently, making it well-suited for high-performance applications.</p>

<ul>
<li>This project contains the implementation of a MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor using the Verilog hardware description language. The processor contains five stages: instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode (ID), execute (EX), memory access (MEM), and write back (WB).</li>
<li>The processor supports the following instructions: add, addi, sub, and, andi, or, ori, slt, slti, lw, sw, beq, and j. <b>The processor also supports pipelining , data hazards and overflow detection to improve performance.</b></li>
<li>The project includes a testbench that uses a set of assembly programs to verify the functionality of the processor. The testbench also includes automated tests to check the correctness of the processor's output.</li>
<li>Overall, this project provides a useful resource for those interested in MIPS processor design and implementation, and can be a valuable addition to any hardware design or computer architecture portfolio.</li>
</ul>


<p><i>This implementation can be used as a starting point for anyone interested in learning about MIPS processors or implementing their own MIPS processor. The project is open-source and contributions are welcome.</i></p>
