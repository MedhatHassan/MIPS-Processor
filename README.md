<h1>MIPS Processor Implementation in VHDL</h1>
<p>The MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor is a type of Reduced Instruction Set Computer<b> (RISC) </b>microprocessor architecture. It was developed by MIPS Technologies in the 1980s and has since been used in a variety of embedded systems, such as routers, gaming consoles, and digital cameras.

The MIPS processor is characterized by its simplicity, high performance, and low power consumption. It has a fixed instruction length of 32 bits and a simple instruction set that consists of only a few basic instructions. This allows the processor to execute instructions quickly and efficiently, making it well-suited for high-performance applications.</p>

<ul>
<li>This project contains the implementation of a MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor using the Verilog hardware description language. The processor contains five stages: instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode (ID), execute (EX), memory access (MEM), and write back (WB).</li>
